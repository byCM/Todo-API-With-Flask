# Todo Api with Flask

## Instructions

A fellow student of yours in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree has just taken the Angular Basics course and has a pretty nice working Angular.js Todo app. They went a little farther and used the ng-resource plugin which allows the application to work automatically using RESTful practices. However, they donâ€™t have experience yet on the server side of things. But you do. Can you help them out?

The ability to provide a back-end for a client-side app is a great skill to have, and you will encounter the need to do this throughout your journey. As long as their app is functioning they will be happy.

## Requirements
>- Peewee model classes for adding, editing and deleting Todo entries
>- GET /api/v1/todos returns all todos and populates the web application
>- POST /api/v1/todos creates a new Todo, returns it and sets the appropriate status code.
>- PUT /api/v1/todos/XXX is handled and proper Todo is updated.
>- DELETE /api/v1/todos/XXX deletes the appropriate Todo sends back the appropriate status code and an empty body
>- There are unit tests for all the views, models, and other functions. The tests must cover 50% of code.
>- The code is clean, readable, and well organized. It complies with most common PEP 8 standards of style.
